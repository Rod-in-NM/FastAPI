# FastAPI
I'm following along with this tutorial from Infoworld, on [How to use FastEndpoints in ASP.NET Core](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2515537/how-to-use-fastendpoints-in-asp-net-core.html?utm_date=20240818150736&utm_campaign=Top%20Enterprise%20Stories&utm_content=Title%3A%20How%20to%20use%20FastEndpoints%20in%20ASP.NET%20Core&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20IDG%27s%20Top%20Enterprise%20Stories&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Adestra&huid=979d4114-dfb3-42b6-91ba-3b999c8d5522)

## Postman
The tutorial specifically denied enabling Swagger, so you have to use Postman for testing.

## Summary
From the tutorial:
> FastEndpoints is a free third-party alternative to ASP.NET Core’s built-in legacy controllers and minimal APIs. FastEndpoints combines performance on a par with minimal APIs and a structured approach to handling HTTP requests and responses. I’ll demonstrate how we can implement security, versioning, validation, dependency injection, caching, and rate limiting with FastEndpoints in future posts here.
